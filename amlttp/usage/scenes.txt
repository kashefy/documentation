The |amlttp| is capable of generating auditory scenes under various conditions. The generation is performed by the |BinSim|. The |amlttp| takes care of setting up the simulator and drive it to produce scenes under specific and various conditions using a dataset of sound files.

A scene is configured by specifying:
* The room
* Individual sound sources
* The SNRs of the sound sources relative to one another
* Charactersitics of the virtual head in the room (e.g. orientation)
* The duration of the sounds

This instantiates a scene configuration:
::

   sc = SceneConfig.SceneConfiguration();
   
By default the scene is configured so that sound sources are positioned at 0Â° azimuth relative
to the head. There is no interfering noise, and no reverberation (i.e. free-field conditions).
